name: Windows Defender Context Menu Removed
description: Detects the use of reg.exe or PowerShell to delete the Windows Defender context menu handler registry keys. This action removes the "Scan with Microsoft Defender" option from the right-click menu for files, directories, and drives. Attackers may use this technique to hinder manual, on-demand scans and reduce the visibility of the security product. - May be part of a system customization or "debloating" script, but this is highly unusual in a managed corporate environment.
