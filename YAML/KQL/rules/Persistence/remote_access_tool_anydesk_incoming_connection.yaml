name: Remote Access Tool - AnyDesk Incoming Connection
description: Detects incoming connections to AnyDesk. This could indicate a potential remote attacker trying to connect to a listening instance of AnyDesk and use it as potential command and control channel. - Legitimate incoming connections (e.g. sysadmin activity). Most of the time I would expect outgoing connections (initiated locally).
