name: Exploitation Activity of CVE-2025-59287 - WSUS Suspicious Child Process
description: Detects the creation of command-line interpreters (cmd.exe, powershell.exe) as child processes of Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) related process wsusservice.exe. This behavior is a key indicator of exploitation for the critical remote code execution vulnerability such as CVE-2025-59287, where attackers spawn shells to conduct reconnaissance and further post-exploitation activities. - If this activity is expected, consider filtering based on specific command lines, user context (e.g., `nt authority\network service`), or parent process command lines to reduce noise.
