name: Non-Standard Nsswitch.Conf Creation - Potential CVE-2025-32463 Exploitation
description: Detects the creation of nsswitch.conf files in non-standard directories, which may indicate exploitation of CVE-2025-32463. This vulnerability requires an attacker to create a nsswitch.conf in a directory that will be used during sudo chroot operations. When sudo executes, it loads malicious shared libraries from user-controlled locations within the chroot environment, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation. - Backup locations
