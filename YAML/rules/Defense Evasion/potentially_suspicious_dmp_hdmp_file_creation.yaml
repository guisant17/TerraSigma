name: Potentially Suspicious DMP/HDMP File Creation
description: Detects the creation of a file with the ".dmp"/".hdmp" extension by a shell or scripting application such as "cmd", "powershell", etc. Often created by software during a crash. Memory dumps can sometimes contain sensitive information such as credentials. It's best to determine the source of the crash. - Some administrative PowerShell or VB scripts might have the ability to collect dumps and move them to other folders which might trigger a false positive.
