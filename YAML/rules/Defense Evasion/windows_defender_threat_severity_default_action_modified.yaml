name: Windows Defender Threat Severity Default Action Modified
description: Detects modifications or creations of Windows Defender's default threat action settings based on severity to 'allow' or take 'no action'. This is a highly suspicious configuration change that effectively disables Defender's ability to automatically mitigate threats of a certain severity level, allowing malicious software to run unimpeded. An attacker might use this technique to bypass defenses before executing payloads. - Legitimate administration via scripts or tools (e.g., SCCM, Intune, GPO enforcement). Correlate with administrative activity. - Software installations that legitimately modify Defender settings (less common for these specific keys).
