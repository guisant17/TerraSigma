name: Github Self-Hosted Runner Execution
description: Detects GitHub self-hosted runners executing workflows on local infrastructure that could be abused for persistence and code execution. Shai-Hulud is an npm supply chain worm targeting CI/CD environments. It installs runners on compromised systems to maintain access after credential theft, leveraging their access to secrets and internal networks. - Legitimate GitHub self-hosted runner installations on designated CI/CD infrastructure - Authorized runner deployments by DevOps/Platform teams following change management - Scheduled runner updates or reconfigurations on existing build agents - Self-hosted runners that follow expected/known naming patterns - Installation via expected/known configuration management tools (reflected mostly as parent process name)
