name: Recon Command Output Piped To Findstr.EXE
description: Detects the execution of a potential recon command where the results are piped to "findstr". This is meant to trigger on inline calls of "cmd.exe" via the "/c" or "/k" for example. Attackers often time use this technique to extract specific information they require in their reconnaissance phase.
