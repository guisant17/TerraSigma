name: Python WebServer Execution - Linux
description: Detects the execution of Python web servers via command line interface (CLI). After gaining access to target systems, adversaries may use Python's built-in HTTP server modules to quickly establish a web server without requiring additional software. This technique is commonly used in post-exploitation scenarios as it provides a simple method for transferring files between the compromised host and attacker-controlled systems. - Testing or development activity
