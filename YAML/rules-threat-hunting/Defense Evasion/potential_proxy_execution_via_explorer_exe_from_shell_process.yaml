name: Potential Proxy Execution Via Explorer.EXE From Shell Process
description: Detects the creation of a child "explorer.exe" process from a shell like process such as "cmd.exe" or "powershell.exe". Attackers can use "explorer.exe" for evading defense mechanisms by proxying the execution through the latter. While this is often a legitimate action, this rule can be use to hunt for anomalies. Muddy Waters threat actor was seeing using this technique. - Legitimate explorer.exe run from a shell host like "cmd.exe" or "powershell.exe"
