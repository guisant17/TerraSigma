// Title: Potential LSASS Process Dump Via Procdump
// Author: Florian Roth (Nextron Systems)

// Description: Detects potential credential harvesting attempts through LSASS memory dumps using ProcDump.
// This rule identifies suspicious command-line patterns that combine memory dump flags (-ma, -mm, -mp) with LSASS-related process markers.
// LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) contains sensitive authentication data including plaintext passwords, NTLM hashes, and Kerberos tickets in memory.
// Attackers commonly dump LSASS memory to extract credentials for lateral movement and privilege escalation.

// False Positives:
//   - Unlikely, because no one should dump an lsass process memory
//   - Another tool that uses command line flags similar to ProcDump
