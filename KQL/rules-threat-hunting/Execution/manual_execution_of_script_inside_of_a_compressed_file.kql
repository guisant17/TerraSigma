// Title: Manual Execution of Script Inside of a Compressed File
// Author: @kostastsale
// Date: 2023-02-15
// Level: medium
// Description: This is a threat-hunting query to collect information related to the interactive execution of a script from inside a compressed file (zip/rar). Windows will automatically run the script using scripting interpreters such as wscript and cscript binaries.
// From the query below, the child process is the script interpreter that will execute the script. The script extension is also a set of standard extensions that Windows OS recognizes. Selections 1-3 contain three different execution scenarios.
//     1. Compressed file opened using 7zip.
//     2. Compressed file opened using WinRar.
//     3. Compressed file opened using native windows File Explorer capabilities.
// When the malicious script is double-clicked, it will be extracted to the respected directories as signified by the CommandLine on each of the three Selections. It will then be executed using the relevant script interpreter."

// False Positives:
//   - Batch files may produce a lot of noise, as many applications appear to bundle them as part of their installation process. You should baseline your environment and generate a new query excluding the noisy and expected activity. Some false positives may come up depending on your environment. All results should be investigated thoroughly before filtering out results.
