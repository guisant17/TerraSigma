// Title: Python Image Load By Non-Python Process
// Author: Patrick St. John, OTR (Open Threat Research)

// Level: low
// Description: Detects the image load of "Python Core" by a non-Python process. This might be indicative of a execution of executable that has been bundled from Python code.
// Various tools like Py2Exe, PyInstaller, and cx_Freeze are used to bundle Python code into standalone executables.
// Threat actors often use these tools to bundle malicious Python scripts into executables, sometimes to obfuscate the code or to bypass security measures.

// False Positives:
//   - Legitimate Py2Exe Binaries
//   - Known false positive caused with Python Anaconda
//   - Various legitimate software is bundled from Python code into executables
