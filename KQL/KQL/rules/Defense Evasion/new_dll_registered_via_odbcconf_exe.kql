// Description: Detects execution of "odbcconf" with "REGSVR" in order to register a new DLL (equivalent to running regsvr32). Attackers abuse this to install and run malicious DLLs.
// MITRE Tactic: Defense Evasion
// Tags: attack.defense-evasion, attack.t1218.008
// False Positives:
//   - Legitimate DLLs being registered via "odbcconf" will generate false positives. Investigate the path of the DLL and its content to determine if the action is authorized.
