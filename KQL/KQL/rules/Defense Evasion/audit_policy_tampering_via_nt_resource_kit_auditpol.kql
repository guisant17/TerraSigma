// Title: Audit Policy Tampering Via NT Resource Kit Auditpol
// Author: Nasreddine Bencherchali (Nextron Systems)

// Level: high
// Description: Threat actors can use an older version of the auditpol binary available inside the NT resource kit to change audit policy configuration to impair detection capability.
// This can be carried out by selectively disabling/removing certain audit policies as well as restoring a custom policy owned by the threat actor.
// MITRE Tactic: Defense Evasion

// False Positives:
//   - The old auditpol utility isn't available by default on recent versions of Windows as it was replaced by a newer version. The FP rate should be very low except for tools that use a similar flag structure
