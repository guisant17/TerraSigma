// Title: Potential CVE-2024-3400 Exploitation - Palo Alto GlobalProtect OS Command Injection - File Creation
// Author: Andreas Braathen (mnemonic.io)
// Date: 2024-04-25
// Level: medium
// Description: Detects suspicious file creations in the Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS' parent telemetry folder, which are processed by the vulnerable 'dt_curl' script if device telemetry is enabled.
// As said script overrides the shell-subprocess restriction, arbitrary command execution may occur by carefully crafting filenames that are escaped through this function.
// MITRE Tactic: Execution
// Tags: attack.execution, cve.2024-3400, detection.emerging-threats
// False Positives:
//   - The PAN-OS device telemetry function does not enforce a standard filename convention, but observations are unlikely.
