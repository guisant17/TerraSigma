The policy is placed in the privileged Windows Code Integrity folder (C:\\Windows\\System32\\CodeIntegrity\\). Upon reboot, the policy prevents EDR drivers from loading, effectively bypassing security measures and may further enable undetected lateral movement within an Active Directory environment. - May occur legitimately as part of admin activity, but rarely with interactive elevation."
