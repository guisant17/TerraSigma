It allows users to transfer bookmarks, browsing history, and other preferences from Internet Explorer to Firefox or vice versa. It can be abused as a tool to side load any DLL. If a folder is provided in the command line it'll load any DLL with one of the following names \"mozcrt19.dll\", \"mozsqlite3.dll\", or \"sqlite.dll\". Arbitrary DLLs can also be loaded if a specific number of flags was provided."
