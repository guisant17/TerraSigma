Windows creates short 8.3 filenames (like PROGRA~1) for compatibility with MS-DOS-based or 16-bit Windows programs. When investigating, examine: - Commands using short paths to access sensitive directories or files - Web servers on Windows (especially Apache) where short filenames could bypass security controls - Correlation with other suspicious behaviors - baseline of short name usage in your environment and look for deviations - Applications could use this notation occasionally which might generate some false positives. In that case investigate the parent and child process."
