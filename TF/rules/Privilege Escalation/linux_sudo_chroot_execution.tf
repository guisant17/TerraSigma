Attackers may use this technique to evade detection and execute commands in a modified environment. This can be part of a privilege escalation strategy, as it allows the execution of commands with elevated privileges in a controlled environment as seen in CVE-2025-32463. While investigating, look out for unusual or unexpected use of 'sudo --chroot' in conjunction with other commands or scripts such as execution from temporary directories or unusual user accounts. - Legitimate administrative tasks or scripts that use 'sudo --chroot' for containerization, testing, or system management."
