Note that backup software and legitimate administrator might perform similar actions during troubleshooting. - Administrator or backup activity - An unknown bug seems to trigger the Windows \"svchost\" process to drop EVTX files in the \"C:\\Windows\\Temp\" directory in the form \"<log_name\">_<uuid>.evtx\".
