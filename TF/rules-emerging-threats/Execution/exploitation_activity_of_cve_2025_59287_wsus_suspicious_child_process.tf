This behavior is a key indicator of exploitation for the critical remote code execution vulnerability such as CVE-2025-59287, where attackers spawn shells to conduct reconnaissance and further post-exploitation activities. - If this activity is expected, consider filtering based on specific command lines, user context (e.g., `nt authority\\network service`), or parent process command lines to reduce noise."
